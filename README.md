## Description
This is a model that implements a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits using the dataset MNIST, where you can upload an image and the system will scan and predict the number.

The project includes image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, with an accuracy of 98.4%.

## Objective
-Understand the flow of the CC mdel in Machine learning
-Learn the structure of CNN and its layers
-Explore practical applications

## Use
Install:
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn pillow

1. Train the model
2. Draw a handwritten digit
3. Save the image in the directory
4. Enter the image name in **predict_digit('7.png')**
5. Run
